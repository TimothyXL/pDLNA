For detailed information regarding the installation, please read the
'pDLNA Installation, Configuration and Debugging Guide' available under
http://www.pdlna.org/cgi-bin/index.pl?menu=download&type=icdguide&version=latest

INSTALLATION REQUIREMENTS
-------------------------
Since pDLNA requires some Perl modules, please see chapter 2 of the
'pDLNA Installation, Configuration and Debugging Guide' available under
http://www.pdlna.org/cgi-bin/index.pl?menu=download&type=icdguide&version=latest

You are also able to execute 'install.pl -c' to see, which Perl modules
are needed and which are already installed.

INSTALL
---------------
Just run the script called 'install.pl -h' to get initial help for
setting the right parameters for your installation. The script will
also check for requirements, copies the files to the correct directories
and sets the necessary rights.

At the end, if all tests passed, you should be able to edit '/etc/pdlna.conf'
and start pDLNA with the initscript located at '/etc/init.d/rc.pdlna'.
